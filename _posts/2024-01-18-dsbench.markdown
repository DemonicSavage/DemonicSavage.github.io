I have made a really small and simple one-function library to help me benchmark different algorithms.

It may be simply a decorator that tracks the time it takes to run a function, although there are a few cool (but very specific) features such as cumulative benchmarking.

This lives now as DSBench, you can find it in my GitHub or by clicking [here](dsbench).
