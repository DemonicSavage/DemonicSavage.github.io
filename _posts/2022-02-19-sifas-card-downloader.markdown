I'm working on an idol.st SIFAS card downloader for Linux, which is currently able to download and organize cards and stills in folders.

You can get it [here](https://www.github.com/demonicsavage/sifas_card_downloader).

This is very WIP and I'm not very proud of the way the code is right now.

It does work, though - and it's useful if you like to set a wallpaper slideshow of SIFAS cards, as this makes it easier to update the cards.
