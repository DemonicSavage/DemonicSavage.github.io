SIFAS Card Downloader is dead, long live Mikan!

This is a very belated announcement, as Mikan has been the tool's name for months.

The name just didn't make sense anymore after it got support for SIF2 and various other idol-ish Gacha games.

Mikan is a reference to Chika Takami, who is one of my favorite Aqours characters. It is also a short, memorable and easy to pronounce name.

For PyPI reasons, the name of the package you install is `mikan-card-downloader`, but the executable is `mikan` (and so is the Python module).

There are more features in the recent versions and more are planned.
